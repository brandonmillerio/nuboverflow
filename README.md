# Nuboverflow

## Getting started

To get started using this app, all you have to do is follow the below steps:
  - Make sure you have NodeJs installed.
  - Clone the Repository
  - run the command `npm install`
  - after node_modules has been installed, simply run `npm start` to start the app.

## Contributing
This project uses a git-flow structure.

If this is your first contribution, you will be required to make a "fork" of the repository and submit your changes as a PR. If you are a part of the team, you will be able to just create a branch.

**Please make sure your branch/fork is based off of 'develop'. The master branch is used as a source of truth.**

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**PR's submitted that have been ejected will be rejected. While it may be necessary to eject at some point, this is a team decision.**

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
